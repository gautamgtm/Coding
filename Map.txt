MAP : Insert vs []

Insert :
Insert elements
Extends the container by inserting new elements, effectively increasing the container size by the number of elements inserted.

Because element keys in a map are unique, the insertion operation checks whether each inserted element has a key equivalent to the one of an element already in the container, 
and if so, the element is not inserted, returning an iterator to this existing element (if the function returns a value).

[] :
If k matches the key of an element in the container, the function returns a reference to its mapped value.

If k does not match the key of any element in the container, the function inserts a new element with that key and returns a reference to its mapped value. Notice that this always 
increases the container size by one, even if no mapped value is assigned to the element (the element is constructed using its default constructor).
